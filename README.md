You can install these using pip:

```

## Data Preprocessing

In order to preprocess our data, normally we would fill gaps in our data, but because our dataset does not contain any we will skip this step. So, we will first sclae the features in order to make them easier to compare. Then convert the score variable and text into a format that can be easily manipulated by our machine learning model.
